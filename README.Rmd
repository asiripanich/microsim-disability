# microsim-disability

This microsimulation model simulates disability progression using a Markov Chain model. One can simulate from a Markov chain by noting that the collection of moves from any given state (the corresponding row in the probability matrix) form a multinomial distribution. One can thus simulate from a Markov Chain by simulating from a multinomial distribution.

```{r, fig.cap="State diagram", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/state-diagram.png")
```

## Setup the environment

We use the (dymiumCore)[https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumCore] package which provides the basic building blocks for microsimulation in R to develop our microsimulation model below. 

```{r setup}
library(dymiumCore)
library(data.table)
set.seed(1)
```

## Import data and model

```{r}
# load a population
population <- 
  fread("data/base.csv") %>%
  .[, sex := ifelse(female == 1, "female", "male")] %>%
  .[, c("female") := NULL] %>%
  .[, state := factor(x = state, levels = 1:3, labels = c("healthy", "mild", "severe"))]

# create World
w <- World$new()
a <- Agent$new(.data = population, id_col = "id")

# add Agent to World
w$add(a, name = "Agent")

# convert the transition matrix model to a format that dymiumCore can understand
# see https://core.dymium.org/articles/dymium-intro.html#transition
trans_model <-
  fread("data/tprob.csv") %>%
  .[, `:=`(probs = .(c(healthy, mild, severe, death)),
           choices = .(c("healthy", "mild", "severe", "death"))), 
    by = 1:nrow(.)] %>%
  setnames(old = "from", new = "state") %>%
  .[, sex := ifelse(female == 1, "female", "male")] %>%
  .[, c("healthy", "mild", "severe", "death", "female") := NULL]
```

## Create microsimulation events

```{r}
event_disability <- function(w, model) {
  
  Agt <- w$get("Agent")
  
  # select only agents that are older than 50 years old
  eligible_agent_ids <- Agt$get_data()[age > 50 & state != "death",
                                       get(Agt$get_id_col())]
  
  TransitionDisability <- 
    TransitionClassification$new(
      x = Agt, 
      model = model, 
      targeted_agents = eligible_agent_ids
    )
  
  # use the simulated result to update the 'state' attribute of the selected agents
  TransitionDisability$update_agents(attr = "state")

  Agt$log(desc = "disability:state",
          value = xtabs(~ state, data = Agt$get_data()))
  
  return(w)
}

event_age <- function(w) {
  Agt <- w$get("Agent")
  
  # update age of alive agents, with max of 114.
  Agt$get_data(copy = FALSE) %>%
    .[state != "death", age := ifelse(age + 1L > 114L, 114L, age + 1L)]
  
  return(w)
}
```


## Microsimulation pipeline

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  w$start_iter(time_step = i, unit = "year") %>%
    event_age(.) %>%
    event_disability(., trans_model)
}
```

## Visualisation

```{r}
library(purrr) # for working with lists
library(ggplot2)

simlog <- get_log(w)

statelog <- 
  purrr::map2_dfr(simlog$time, simlog$value, ~ {
    .y %>% 
      as.data.table() %>%
      .[, time := .x]
  })

ggplot(data = statelog, aes(x = time, y = N, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
  labs(title = "Disability status")
```
